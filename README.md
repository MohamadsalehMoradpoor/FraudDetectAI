# FraudDetectAI

FraudDetectAI is a project aimed at developing an artificial intelligence-based system for fraud detection. The system utilizes advanced machine learning techniques to analyze and identify fraudulent activities in various domains.

## Features

- **ODABOD.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook containing the implementation of the ODABOD (Outlier Detection with Autoencoders using Bagging of Deep models) algorithm for fraud detection.

- **ODLOF.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook containing the implementation of the ODLOF (Outlier Detection with Local Outlier Factors) algorithm for fraud detection.

## Getting Started

To get started with FraudDetectAI, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/FraudDetectAI.git
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Open the Jupyter Notebooks `ODABOD.ipynb` and `ODLOF.ipynb` to explore and run the fraud detection algorithms.
